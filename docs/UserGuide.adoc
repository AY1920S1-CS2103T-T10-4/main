== Introduction

Thank you for checking out TimeBook!

TimeBook is an application to store your friends’ information and schedule.
The unique feature of TimeBook is that it can assist you to find *free time* for you and your group of friends to *meet up for projects,
meals or casual drinking sessions* based on you and your friends’ schedules.
In addition, *TimeBook* has been optimised for those who prefer using *Command Line Interface (CLI)* while keeping the benefits of a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*.
Furthermore, *TimeBook* has a simple and optimised *User Interface (UI)* and *User Experience (UX)* to cater for users who have never used a CLI at all.

== Understanding this guide
=== Basic Information
This guide is a explains how you can use *TimeBook* to the fullest extent to assist you to plan for your group's meeting.

You can find the steps needed to start scheduling group activities with your friends or loved ones in the quick start and general
*lifecycle* usage of our application. If you happen to stumble upon some difficulties, our *Frequently Asked Questions* (FAQ) is
here to address that. If you are an experienced *Command Line Interface (CLI)* user, you can hope right into using the application by
looking at our *Command Summary*. Otherwise, take a look at the *Unexperienced CLI user* section to obtain more information on how
