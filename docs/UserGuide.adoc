By: `Team TimeBook`      Since: `Aug 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

Our team is still working on the User Guide. Keep a look out for more cool and exciting features coming soon!

== Introduction

Thank you for checking out TimeBook! TimeBook is a desktop application that is morphed from AddressBook Level 3 (AB3). TimeBook is a scheduler application that aims to help busy NUS undergraduates keep track of the schedules of the user and his or her friends. It also can find the common free time and venues among the user and his or her friends. TimeBook will have the following features:

.  A graphical user interface (GUI) but most of the interactions with the application would happen using command line interface (CLI).
.  Allows users to add the schedules of his or her friends and organise them into groups.
.  Deconflict different schedules of different people and different groups to find the common free time among them.
.  Integration with NUSmods API to allow users to enter their NUSmods timetable link to add it to their schedule.
.  Integration with Google Maps API to allow the application to evaluate the best venue for the group to meet up during the free time in their schedules.

== Understanding this guide
=== Basic Information
This guide is a explains how you can use *TimeBook* to the fullest extent to assist you to plan for your group's meeting.

You can find the steps needed to start scheduling group activities with your friends or loved ones in the quick start and general
*lifecycle* usage of our application. If you happen to stumble upon some difficulties, our *Frequently Asked Questions* (FAQ) is
here to address that. If you are an experienced *Command Line Interface (CLI)* user, you can hope right into using the application by
looking at our *Command Summary*. Otherwise, take a look at the *Unexperienced CLI user* section to obtain more information on how
to use our application.

We have used the following symbols to help you better understand our application usage. (For now we have not picked our symbols yet.)

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `timebook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TimeBook.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::startupwindow.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all information in TimeBook.
* *`addperson`* `n/John Doe p/98765432 em/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the TimeBook.
* *`deleteperson`* `n/John Doe` : deletes the person named `John Doe` from the TimeBook.
* *`addgroup`* `g/CS2103` : adds a new group called `CS2103` to the TimeBook.
* *`addtogroup`* `n/John Doe` `g/CS2103` : Adds a person `John Doe` into the group `CS2103`.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Unexperienced CLI user

Unlike most applications, where you use your mouse to interact with the application such as scrolling and clicking, our application
mostly use the *Command Line Interface*. Most of the time, you would be interacting with the application through typing commands in the
command box of the application.

You can play around with the commands in <<Command Summary>> to get yourself warmed up.

=== Suggestions Autocomplete

TimeBook comes with a helpful feature that provides suggested commands or relevant values so you can spend less time typing commands and more time on your group meetings.

When you type a command, TimeBook will show a dropdown with similarly matching commands. For example, you type in the command `add`. TimeBook will then suggest commands such as `addevent`, `addgroup`, `addperson` like so:

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step1.png[width=50%]

If you meant to type the `addevent` command, you can immediately select it by pressing the kbd:[Tab] key. Otherwise, you can pick other options by using the kbd:[Up] or kbd:[Down] arrow keys and then hit the kbd:[Tab] key to confirm your selection. For now, try selecting the `addtogroup` command. TimeBook will complete the command like this:

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step2.png[width=50%]

*****
tip: You can type an abbreviated version of the command as long as the letters are in order! For example, instead of typing `addtogroup`, try `atg`.
*****

Remember how TimeBook can also suggest relevant values? Let's try that by specifying a person's name using the `n/` parameter like so:

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step3.png[width=50%]

Again, TimeBook provides useful suggestions, in this case, the names of the people we've previously added. Now, try using the kbd:[Tab] key to immediately fill in "Bobby".

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step4.png[width=50%]

Now, let's complete the `addtogroup` command. Let's add Bobby to the Friends group by typing `g/` and using the suggestions to help us pick the Friends group.

[width="100%",cols="^3,^1,^3",frame="none",grid="none",valign="middle"]
|=======
a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step5.png[] | –kbd:[Tab]–> a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step6.png[]
|=======

Let's say we change our mind and don't want to add Bobby to the Friends group. No problem, just remove Bobby's name and pick someone else using the familiar kbd:[Up], kbd:[Down] and kbd:[Tab] keys. TimeBook is smart enough to only fill in the name parameter and won't mess up the rest of your command.
[width="100%",cols="^3,^1,^3",frame="none",grid="none",valign="middle"]
|=======
a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step7.png[] | –kbd:[Tab]–> a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step8.png[]
|=======

Congratulations! You've now mastered the suggestions feature using just three simple keys, the kbd:[Up] and kbd:[Down] arrow keys to navigate between suggestions and the kbd:[Tab] key to select it. +
The following sections will explain all the commands we have in TimeBook and what they do.

[[Features]]
