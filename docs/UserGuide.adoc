== Introduction

TimeBook is an application to store your friends’ information and schedule. The unique feature of TimeBook is that it can find free time for you and your group of friends to meet up for projects, meals or casual drinking sessions based on you and your friends’ schedules. In addition, TimeBook has been optimised for those who prefer using Command Line Interface (CLI) while keeping the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Furthermore, TimeBook has a simple yet useful User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) to cater for users who have never used a CLI at all. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TimeBook.
