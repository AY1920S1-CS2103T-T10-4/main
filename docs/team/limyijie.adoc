=== About the project

Our team of 5 members were tasked to either enhance or morph an existing command line
interface desktop address book application for our Software Engineering project. We chose
to morph the original application into a group scheduling application called TimeBook.
TimeBook aims to help busy NUS undergraduates keep track of the schedules of the user and his or her friends, and
aid the user to arrange meetings with his or her friends.

This is a screenshot of our application.

The problem assigned to me was that it is tedious and difficult to identify common free time slots among NUS undergraduates
by inspecting separate NUSMods schedules especially when the group size is large. Therefore, my role was to design and write codes to
display the combined schedules of NUS undergraduates from a group in the GUI elegantly and intuitively.
In the following sections, my contribution and the relevant documentations that I have made will be elaborated in more detail.

Note the common symbols and formatting used in this document.

==== Overview of contributions
This section provides an overview of the code, documentation and administrative contributions to the team project

===== Main feature added: The schedule graphic of multiple schedules in TimeBook.

* What: Enables users to see an elegant individual or group 7-day schedule graphic in the form of a time table in TimeBook. The `show` command does this.
* Justification: This is the key feature of TimeBook as it directly addresses the problem of having to tediously cross reference every separate schedule in order to identify free time slots for group meetings.
* Highlights: This feature that I have implemented fits well with the other features that my teammates developed. For example, one of my teammates developed
an NUSMods parser that makes use of parsing NUSMods links into data that is then displayed using my feature. Implementing this feature is not easy as I had to first create an empty time table
and figure out a way to add events (represented by blocks) into this empty time table without distorting the other contents in the time table. In addition, I had to design the graphic
such that resizing the application or adjusting the screen resolution will not distort the time table. Finally, I had to test my feature using TestFX to make sure that the graphic generated is correct.
* Credits: TestFX for providing a framework for automated GUI testing.

====== Additional features that enhances the schedule graphic shown in TimeBook.

. Scroll the schedule graphic when it does not fit the user's screen through the Command Line Interface (CLI). This is done through the `scroll` command.
. Toggle the schedule graphic to show the graphics for subsequent week's schedule. This is done through the `togglenext` command.
. Look at only schedules belonging to some members of a group. This is done through the `lookat` command.

Other contributions:

==== Contributions to User Guide
Our team had to override the original addressbook documentation with the instructions for TimeBook. This section shows my contributions
to the User Guide and my ability to convey instructions for the application that my team has developed to target users. I included the sections *Show person: `show`*
and *Show group: `show`* in the User Guide, and I decided to omit *Show person: `show`* in this section as these two parts in the User Guide are very similar.

The documentation I wrote for *Show person: `show`* can still be accessed {repoURL}/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[here].
