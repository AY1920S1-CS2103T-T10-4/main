== About the project

Our team of 5 members were tasked to either enhance or morph an existing command line
interface desktop address book application for our Software Engineering project. We chose
to morph the original application into a group scheduling application called TimeBook.
TimeBook aims to help busy NUS undergraduates keep track of the schedules of the user and his or her friends, and
aid the user to arrange meetings with his or her friends.

This is a screenshot of our application.

The problem assigned to me was that it is tedious and difficult to identify common free time slots among NUS undergraduates
by inspecting separate NUSMods schedules especially when the group size is large. Therefore, my role was to design and write codes to
display the combined schedules of NUS undergraduates from a group in the GUI elegantly and intuitively.
In the following sections, my contribution and the relevant documentations that I have made will be elaborated in more detail.

=== Overview of contributions
This section provides an overview of the code, documentation and administrative contributions to the team project

==== Main feature added: The schedule graphic of multiple schedules in TimeBook.

* What: Enables users to see an elegant individual or group schedule graphic in the form of a time table in TimeBook. The `show` command does this.
* Justification: This is the key feature of TimeBook as it directly addresses the problem of having to tediously cross reference every separate schedule in order to identify free time slots for group meetings.
* Highlights: This feature that I have implemented fits well with the other features that my teammates developed. For example, one of my teammates developed
an NUSMods parser that makes use of parsing NUSMods links into data that is then displayed using my feature. Implementing this feature is not easy as I had to first create an empty time table
and figure out a way to add events (represented by blocks) into this empty time table without distorting the other time table cells. This means that I had to ensure
that no matter how small the event's duration is, it must still fit and not cause distortion in the schedule graphic. In addition, I needed to ensure that the final schedule graphic can be
controlled. Lastly, I had to test my feature using TestFX to make sure that the graphic generated is correct.
* Credits: TestFX for providing a framework for automated GUI testing.

Other contributions:

* Community
** Helped to develop non-trivial UI components for my team members. #237
* Documentation
** Made user guide and developer guide more reader-friendly.
* Tools
** Set up TestFX for GUI Testing. #206
** Created a google spreadsheet for the team to share bugs the they have found.

=== Contributions to User Guide
Our team had to override the original addressbook User Guide with the instructions for TimeBook. This section shows my contributions
to the User Guide and my ability to convey instructions for the application that my team has developed to target users.
